# Chapter 3: Operators in Programming

## Overview
This repository contains learning materials and code examples based on **Chapter 3: Operators in Programming**. The topics covered in this chapter focus on mathematical, logical, and bitwise operators, along with their proper usage in programming.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Working with Math Operators  
Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. Using Assignment Operators  
Understand how assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.) are used to assign values to variables efficiently.

### 3. Obeying the Order of Precedence  
Discover how mathematical expressions follow an order of operations (similar to PEMDAS in mathematics) to produce the correct results.

### 4. Working with Relational Operators  
Get familiar with comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and their role in decision-making structures.

### 5. Using Logical Operators  
Learn how to use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) for combining multiple conditions in decision-making.

### 6. Understanding Bitwise Operators  
Explore bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) to manipulate individual bits in integers.

### 7. Shifting Bits  
Dive into left and right bit shifting (`<<`, `>>`) to efficiently perform multiplication or division by powers of two.

### 8. Exploring Unary Operators  
Understand unary operators such as increment (`++`), decrement (`--`), and negation (`-`).

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge: Do Some Math**  
  A hands-on coding challenge to apply math operators in real-world scenarios.

- **Challenge: Get the Order Correct**

# Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

## Overview
This repository contains learning materials and code examples based on **Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops**. This chapter covers essential control flow concepts, including conditional statements, loops, and iterative structures that allow efficient program execution.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Making a Decision  
Learn how to use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`) to make decisions in your program.

### 2. Exploring the Possibilities  
Understand how different conditions and multiple decision branches influence program flow.

### 3. Using the Ternary Operator  
Discover how to simplify conditional expressions using the ternary (`?:`) operator.

### 4. Working with the Switch-Case Structure  
Explore how to use `switch-case` (or equivalent constructs in Python and other languages) for decision-making.

## Looping Structures

### 5. Creating a For Loop  
Learn how `for` loops allow iteration over sequences, lists, or ranges.

### 6. Setting Up a While Loop  
Understand how `while` loops execute code repeatedly based on a condition.

### 7. Nesting Loops  
Dive into loops within loops to handle complex iteration structures.

### 8. Breaking Out of a Loop
